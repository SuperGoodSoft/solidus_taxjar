# `SuperGood::SolidusTaxjar` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SuperGoodSoft/solidus_taxjar.svg?token=rc5QTgHvLLF7cpqkmyfd&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/SuperGoodSoft/solidus_taxjar)

`SuperGood::SolidusTaxjar` is a [Solidus](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus) extension that allows Solidus stores to use [TaxJar](https://www.taxjar.com/) for tax calculations.

This is not a fork of [spree_taxjar](https://github.com/vinsol-spree-contrib/spree_taxjar), like [solidus_taxjar](https://github.com/boomerdigital/solidus_taxjar). Instead of using a custom calculator, `SuperGood::SolidusTaxjar` uses the new configurable tax system [by @adammathys](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/pull/1892) introduced in Solidus v2.4. This maps better to how the TaxJar API itself works.

## Installation

1. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

   ```ruby
   gem 'super_good_solidus_taxjar'
   ```

   And then execute:

       $ bundle

2. Install and run the necessary migrations:

   ```shell
   bundle exec rails g super_good:solidus_taxjar:install
   bundle exec rake db:migrate
   ```

3. Next, configure Solidus to use this gem:

   ```ruby
   # Put this in config/initializers/solidus.rb

   Spree.config do |config|
     config.tax_calculator_class = SuperGood::SolidusTaxjar::TaxCalculator
   end
   ```

4. Also, configure your error handling:

   ```ruby
   # Put this in config/initializers/taxjar.rb

   SuperGood::SolidusTaxjar.exception_handler = ->(e) {
     # Report exceptions in here. For example, if you were using the Sentry's
     # raven-ruby gem to report errors, you might do this:
     Raven.capture_exception(e)
   }
   ```

5. Finally, make sure that the `TAXJAR_API_KEY` environment variable is set to a your TaxJar API key and make sure that you have a `Spree::TaxRate` with the name "Sales Tax". This will be used as the source for the tax adjustments that Solidus creates.

## Upgrading from 0.X to 1.0.X

If you're currently using version 0.X and want to upgrade to 1.0.X, follow these steps:

- Upgrade to at least Rails version 5.2.0. This is due to 1.0.X requiring the `active_storage` gem
- Rename the gem `super_good-solidus_taxjar` to `super_good_solidus_taxjar` in your Gemfile
- Rename any instances of the module `SolidusTaxJar` to `SolidusTaxjar`
- Rename any instances of the class `API` to `Api`
- Rename any instances of the class `APIParams` to `ApiParams`

## Project Status

Requirements for TaxJar integrations vary as some stores also need reporting, which isn't provided out of the box by this extension. This is because individual stores will be using different background job frameworks or runners (Sidekiq, delayed_job, ActiveJob, etc.) and a reliable integration will rely on one of these. Because this part of the integration is small, we've chosen to provide the transaction reporting functionality, but have skipped directly integrating it.

If you're having trouble integrating this extension with your store and would like some assistance, please reach out to Jared via e-mail at [jared@super.gd](mailto:jared@super.gd) or on the official Solidus as `@jared`.

## Features

The extension provides currently two high level `calculator` classes that wrap the low-level Ruby taxjar gem API calls:

* tax calculator
* tax rate calculator

The extension also provides two ActiveRecord classes that represent Taxjar Exempt Regions Taxjar Customers:

* exempt region
* customer


### TaxCalculator

`SuperGood::SolidusTaxjar::TaxCalculator` allows calculating the full tax breakdown for a given `Spree::Order`. The breakdown includes separate line items taxes and shipment taxes.

### TaxRateCalculator

`SuperGood::SolidusTaxjar::TaxRateCalculator` allows calculating the tax rate for a given `Spree::Address`. It relies on the same low-level Ruby TaxJar API endpoint of the tax calculator in order to provide the most coherent and reliable results. TaxJar support recommends using this endpoint for live calculations.

### ExemptRegion

`SuperGood::SolidusTaxjar::ExemptRegion` is an ActiveRecord model used for storing TaxJar Exempt Region information. It contains exempt region information such as the State the customer is tax exempt from as well as the tax exemption document as an active storage attachment.

### Customer

`SuperGood::SolidusTaxjar::Customer` is an ActiveRecord model used for storing TaxJar tax exempt customer information. It has many TaxJar Exempt Regions.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
